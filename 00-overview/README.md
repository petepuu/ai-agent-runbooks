# What is AI Agent Runbooks?

## Overview

**AI Agent Runbooks** is an open, community-driven repository hosted on GitHub, designed to accelerate the delivery of production-ready AI Agent solutions built on Microsoft technologies.

This repository was born from real-world delivery experience across enterprise engagements where Microsoft Cloud Solution Architects and Technical Specialists identified a recurring need: structured, reusable, and validated guidance for building AI Agents at scale.

Rather than starting from scratch on every engagement, AI Agent Runbooks packages proven delivery knowledge into a consistent, navigable format — so teams can focus on customization and business value, not on rediscovering foundational patterns.

## What is an AI Agent Runbook?

An **AI Agent Runbook** is a structured, end-to-end implementation guide for a specific AI Agent use case. It is designed to take a delivery team from concept to production with a clear, repeatable process.

Each runbook is purpose-built around a real-world business scenario and includes all the assets necessary to understand, design, build, and deploy an AI Agent in an enterprise environment.

### Runbook Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Overview** | Business context, objectives, target users, and expected outcomes of the agent scenario |
| **Architecture** | Solution architecture diagrams, technology stack, integration points, and data flow |
| **Runbook** | Step-by-step implementation instructions covering configuration, development, testing, and deployment |
| **Sample Prompts** | Validated prompt examples for agent topics, trigger phrases, and conversation flows |

## Supported Platforms

AI Agent Runbooks provides guidance across the following Microsoft AI platforms:

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Microsoft Copilot Studio** | Low-code platform for building, testing, and deploying conversational AI agents and copilots across Microsoft 365 and custom channels |
| **Azure AI Foundry** | Enterprise-grade platform for building, evaluating, and deploying custom AI models and agent solutions using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI services |
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot** | Native AI experience embedded in Microsoft 365 apps; extended through declarative agents and Copilot extensibility scenarios |

## Agent Taxonomy

The repository organizes AI Agent scenarios by business domain and agent type. The following taxonomy reflects the categories currently covered or planned within this repository:

| Domain | Agent Name | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Human Resources | HR Onboarding Agent | Guides new employees through onboarding tasks, policy acknowledgments, and first-day workflows |
| Human Resources | [HR Onboarding Agent (GHCP)](../01-scenarios/HR-Onboarding-Agent-GHCP/1.Overview.md) | GitHub Copilot harness adaptation with reusable skills, grounded HR answers, onboarding checklists, and controlled email workflows |
| Employee Experience | [Employee Self-Service Agent (GHCP)](../01-scenarios/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-GHCP/1.Overview.md) | Custom GitHub Copilot harness agent for HR/IT guidance, catalog navigation, and optional authorized own-request status |

Additional scenarios across IT & Operations, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, and Sales domains are planned for future releases.

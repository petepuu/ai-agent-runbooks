# Employee Self-Service Microsoft Copilot Harness capability matrix

**Implementation status:** Seven starter runtime skills adapted from the supplied definitions on 2026-11-11. No deployed tool bindings, workflows, credentials or live test evidence are supplied. All seven live capabilities are OFF until validated.

## Profiles and enabling rules

**Knowledge-only baseline:** approved SharePoint and ServiceNow KB retrieval and source-backed navigation are handled by global instructions and configured knowledge, not separate skills. No action tools are exposed. Enable knowledge only after K passes.

**Starter live scope:** select individual rows below after their gates pass; importing all seven is not required. Tool names come from the supplied skill definitions and are **binding requirements to verify**, not independently verified vendor operation IDs or proof of tenant availability. Record actual schemas, versions, delegated identity and allowed operations in the deployment manifest. Do not retain the old 28-skill set alongside these replacements.

## Capability inventory and import order

| Capability ID / linked SKILL.md | Source behavior / disposition | Tools or knowledge | Actual implementation / operation ID | Dependencies | Profile / access / approval |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [update-workday-home-phone-number-mcp](Skills/update-workday-home-phone-number-mcp/SKILL.md) | Supplied home-phone procedure; replaces broad phone update | Workday-MCP worker/phone reads, home-contact event create/list/update/submit; WD-REST-API reference lookups | Supplied tool names; tenant binding unverified | D, W, H | OFF; existing own home phone only, exact staging/submission approval, one event |
| [get-workday-cost-center](Skills/get-workday-cost-center/SKILL.md) | Supplied Organizations lookup; replaces cost-center alias | WD-REST-API `GET common/v1/{tenant}/workers/me/organizations` | Supplied path; tenant binding unverified | D | OFF; own exact Cost Center assignments, no other organization types |
| [get-workday-employee-information-mcp](Skills/get-workday-employee-information-mcp/SKILL.md) | Supplied employee profile; consolidates requested own details | `find_staffing_workers`; requested `list_worker_addresses`, `list_worker_phone_numbers`, `find_absence_balances` | Supplied Workday-MCP names; tenant binding unverified | D, H | OFF; approved core fields; home contacts/balances only when requested |
| [request-workday-time-off-mcp](Skills/request-workday-time-off-mcp/SKILL.md) | Supplied standard time-off procedure; new starter capability | Worker resolution; `find_worker_eligible_absence_types`, `find_worker_valid_time_off_dates`, `find_worker_time_off_details`, `create_worker_time_off_request` | Supplied Workday-MCP names; tenant binding unverified | D, W, H | OFF; own Time Off / Absence Table only, confirmed submission, no Leave of Absence or approval |
| [create-servicenow-incident](Skills/create-servicenow-incident/SKILL.md) | Supplied incident procedure; replaces broad incident-create alias | `GetIncidents` (trusted own user resolution), `CreateIncident` | Supplied names/parameters; tenant binding unverified | S, W | OFF; own caller, severity + short description, exact confirmation |
| [list-open-servicenow-tickets](Skills/list-open-servicenow-tickets/SKILL.md) | Supplied active-incident list; other-person search removed | `GetIncidents` with fixed active/own-caller filter | Supplied names/query; effective employee identity unverified | S | OFF; own active incidents, three-column table, 50-record coverage limit |
| [list-hr-cases](Skills/list-hr-cases/SKILL.md) | Supplied HR-case list; replaces HR list alias | `GetCases` | Supplied name; own-case/filter behavior unverified | S, H | OFF; own employee-visible cases, four-column table, actual queried state scope |

Dependencies are tool/backend requirements, not additional skill imports:

| Key | Required dependency and exit criterion | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| K | Approved SharePoint/ServiceNow KB source IDs; ACL/user-criteria, citations, freshness and conflict tests | Knowledge + ServiceNow owners |
| S | Approved ServiceNow bindings, unique immutable user mapping, own-record/field enforcement; `gs.getUserID()` must be the employee | ServiceNow + identity owners |
| D | Supported Workday-MCP/WD-REST-API bindings, delegated employee/WID resolution, domain security, endpoint/reference allowlists and actual schemas | Workday + identity owners |
| H | Per-capability HR/privacy approval, field minimization, sensitive absence/home-contact rendering, transcript/memory/retention controls | HR + privacy owners |
| W | Exact-payload trusted confirmation, durable operation/event record, retry deduplication, source-state checks, status reconciliation and bounded read-back | Integration + security owners |

## Deferred and excluded scope

The previous HR-case create/details/latest-update/update/attachment skills, incident details/latest-update/update/attachment skills, Workday email updates and specialist Workday reads (compensation, certifications, company code, emergency contacts, languages, national IDs, passports, visas and dedicated anniversary lookup) are **not shipped or enabled** in this starter set. Requested approved employee-ID/service-date fields may be answered by the profile skill if actually returned; this does not restore specialist operations. No attachments, new phone creation, work-phone edits, Leave of Absence, manager access, catalog checkout or population reporting are implied.

Knowledge answers/navigation remain supported without runtime skills. The planning workbook is a broader illustrative backlog, not the current import manifest: mark any rows outside this matrix deferred/not selected.

[Integration contracts](Integration-contracts.md), [skills index](Skills/README.md) and [acceptance cases](../5.Sample-prompts.md#capability-tests) cover these same seven IDs in this order. Disabling/deleting a skill also requires revoking its tool/backend/alternate-path access and handling active sessions and pending work; preserve shared connections needed by other enabled skills.

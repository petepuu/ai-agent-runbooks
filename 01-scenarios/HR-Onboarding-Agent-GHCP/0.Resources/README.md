These files document one standard scenario for all-employee HR chat and autonomous shared-mailbox replies, with onboarding as a subset and all four skills included by default. They are authoring deliverables, not a solution package. Operators configure and test the dependencies during setup; importing a skill creates no connector, tool, workflow, authorization service or exception queue. No runtime skill links to repository-only supporting files.

## Knowledge and test resources

HR supplies approved handbook, ongoing benefits/wellness, leave-process, workplace and onboarding articles through the configured ServiceNow knowledge source. The [runbook](../3.Runbook.md#phase-1-servicenow-knowledge-base-setup) covers connection setup, source scope, citations and permissions. Production HR articles and tenant configuration are not included.

The local sample Word documents provide synthetic test content, not production policy or the entire acceptance suite. Review their contents before loading them into an isolated test knowledge base. The runbook contains 48 screenshot placements and the connector guide 52, with 100 local images. Screenshots are being refreshed during editing; retained placeholders are not current-UI evidence. Superseded settings are labeled **Screenshot to replace**. The verification URL in `Images/012.png` is redacted because it contains account-verification material; replace it with a safely captured screenshot from your own setup, never an active token.

The [controlled fixtures](../4.Sample-prompts.md#controlled-fixtures) contain self-contained ongoing-employee, onboarding, wellness, conflict and email-contract cases. Load articles only into an isolated test knowledge source and record its actual IDs/URLs; fixture labels are not live citations. Mock intake/backend results can test orchestration without mail credentials. Real email tests additionally require implemented controls, a verified target invocation and release-level pilot authorization.

## Knowledge quality requirements

For each production policy, record authority, population, country/entity/category, effective period, owner and permission rules. If permitted evidence conflicts and lacks a priority or supersession rule, preserve the uncertainty rather than choose an entitlement.

Fixtures F3 and F4 intentionally state **15** and **20 vacation days** for the same test cohort without priority metadata. They test conflict handling, not company policy. Fixture F2 omits monthly medical premiums; an answer must say that the value is unspecified rather than claim it is "Included." Prompt coverage does not establish evidence for personal pay dates, bank-detail setup, leave approval or IT provisioning.

**Gate G2, HR owner:** resolve authoritative production policy or exclude conflicting topics from pilot scope. Keep conflict fixtures in the isolated test corpus. Do not copy synthetic policy facts, contact addresses, credentials or provider recommendations into runtime instructions.

**Autonomous email quality and access:** approve a recipient-audience-safe corpus, or enforce recipient-specific filtering before retrieval and revalidation before send. Connection-owner or application access does not impersonate the employee. Build a versioned HR response catalog and deterministic whole-inquiry request rules for the permitted low-risk topics. The backend validates coverage and evidence and renders only approved source-backed blocks, not free-form model text. Missing evidence, unknown matching rules, medical/personal data, entitlement uncertainty or inaccessible sources hold for HR handling. This intentionally trades automatic coverage for an enforceable authorization boundary.

## Workflow invocation finding

The [Workflows overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/workflows-experience/flows-overview) documents the new GHCP-powered automation experience, including event triggers and agent calls. More specifically, [Add an agent node to a workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/workflows-experience/agent-node-workflow) is marked for the **GitHub Copilot harness** and documents **Workflows > Agent > An existing agent**, selecting a published agent, passing a **Message**, waiting for completion and using the result downstream. This is evidence of **workflow → agent invocation**, not just an agent calling a tool. The page also describes new inline agents, but this scenario targets the existing published HR agent, not a replacement inline agent.

This documents an inbound invocation pattern in the GHCP Workflows experience; it is **not solely the standard-harness agent-flow page**. During standard setup, integration owners select the exact published **HR Onboarding Agent** and record its version, successful isolated invocation, trusted context/result binding, imported skill execution and effective retrieval identity (E1). Product documentation establishes the route, not this tenant's configuration. If the target cannot be selected or invoked, resolve the setup failure before go-live. Do not silently substitute a standard agent or treat a custom value in a connector as proof of support.

The following distinctions prevent false support claims:

- [Standard agent-flow Agent node](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/agent-node-workflow), [direct event triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-trigger-event), and [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/publication-integrate-web-or-native-app-m365-agents-sdk) explicitly describe the **standard harness**. They do not establish direct GHCP autonomous triggers or an inbound API for this agent.
- The [Microsoft Copilot Studio connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/microsoftcopilotstudio/) documents **Execute Agent** (`ExecuteCopilot`) and **Execute Agent and wait** (`ExecuteCopilotAsyncV2`), but does not identify compatible target harnesses. Do not claim those connector operations as a verified GHCP route.
- [Add a workflow as a tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/workflows-experience/flow-agent) requires **When an agent calls the flow** and **Respond to the agent**. That is **agent → workflow**, the opposite direction from incoming HR mail.
- The [GHCP channel table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/agents-experience/publication-channels-overview) marks Email unavailable. External Workflows intake is not a native Email channel. The Studio GHCP harness is not the GitHub Copilot SDK or CLI.

## Mailbox and workflow implementation boundaries

The [Outlook connector reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365/) documents **When a new email arrives in a shared mailbox (V2)** (`SharedMailboxOnNewEmailV2`), requiring mailbox access, and **Reply to email (V3)** (`ReplyToV3`), including original mailbox, message, recipient and Reply All parameters. These are documented primitives, not an implemented HR policy gate.

Use the actual Exchange shared HR mailbox, not a Microsoft 365 group address. Validate delegated connector access separately from send permissions; the connector documents no service-principal authentication. Choose the correct folder, set **Include Attachments = No**, and validate authoritative attachment metadata before allowing a reply. Do not trust From filters as sender authentication. Protected, oversized or invalid messages may be skipped; bursts may miss events and Dynamic Delivery can create duplicate events. HR must retain its normal mailbox coverage, and the integration owner must monitor missed/held events without promising every incoming mail is processed.

The backend must qualify the exact recipient/thread behavior and provider reconciliation of any chosen transport. `ReplyToV3` documentation does not promise a sent-message ID or exactly-once execution. Never invent a transport receipt or blind-retry an uncertain send. All five scenario-defined contracts, durable authorization/outbox state and the fixed exception queue are implemented during setup; executable implementations are not supplied here. A queue failure requires durable failure recording and an approved operator alert, not an unverified "handed to HR" statement.

The [workflow designer guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/workflows-experience/flow-designer#test-your-workflow) warns that node tests call connector APIs and whole-workflow tests run against the live runtime, may save/publish and install connections. **Mock inputs do not make a live send node non-sending.** Isolate the backend and replace mail/queue side effects with test doubles before testing. Do not enable the agent node's emailed human-assistance setting as a substitute for the fixed HR exception queue.

## Official-source verification

"Documented" is evidence about product guidance, not proof that a specific tenant is configured or licensed. The [runbook gates](../3.Runbook.md#release-gates) are authoritative for owner-assigned deployment checks.

**Design choices:** one HR agent, all-employee audience, onboarding as a subset, interactive chat with draft-only replies, autonomous shared-mailbox replies without per-message approval, all four independent skills imported by default, and memory off initially. **Email integration contracts:** the five scenario-defined workflow/backend interfaces and agent result schema in the matrix, implemented during setup rather than claimed as built-in operations. **Deployment values and checks:** in the runbook and its linked [release-readiness resource](Release-readiness.md#release-gates); no unresolved placeholders are embedded in runtime skills. No actual workflow, source-ACL or tenant testing is claimed.
